          Create your own crowdsourced infrastructure intelligence community

        <p>We believe that the people living, working and getting around in their 
          towns and cities are an invaluable asset for decision makers and planners.
          With Infrad you can create a community where everyone can interchange and discuss their ideas,
          initiatives and concerns related to public infrastructure. Changes and progress can 
          be transparantly shared and tracked.</p>
